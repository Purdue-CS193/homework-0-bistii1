# Bisti's first CS193 Homework!!!

## My favorite things about CS193:
- The class is taught by students, which makes it feel more personable
- Fun questions at the start of class!
- Learning **useful tools** for computer science that I wouldn't otherwise in other classes, such as terminal. I had never used terminal before this class so it was very enlightening.
- Class size doesn't feel too big, and lots of kids participate/ask questions
- Even though the class starts late in the day, it goes by pretty fast. The pacing is good.
